;; - if the line is empty:
;;   - if comment-insert-comment-function is non-nil, it calls that.
;;   - otherwise, it directly inserts comment-start and comment-end.
;; - if the line is not empty, it calls comment-indent.
;; comment-indent *also* checks if comment-insert-comment-function is non-nil.
;; - if so, it calls it.
;; - if not, it *also* checks whether the line is empty.
