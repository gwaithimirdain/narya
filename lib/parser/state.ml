(* This module doesn't deal with the reasons why notations are turned on and off.  Instead we just provide a data structure that stores a "notation state", which can be used for parsing, and let other modules manipulate those states by adding notations to them.  (Because we store precomputed trees, removing a notation doesn't work as well; it's probably better to just pull out the set of all notations in a state, remove some, and then create a new state with just those.) *)
