(* A user notation pattern is a nonempty sequence of operator symbols and variable names.  There must be at least one operator symbol, and any two variable names must be separated by at least one symbol.  It is left-closed if the first element is an operator symbol and left-open if the first element is a variable, and similarly for right-open and -closed and the last element.  The two opennesses in turn determine whether it is infix, prefix, postfix, or outfix, but not its associativity or tightness.  *)
