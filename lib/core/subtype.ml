(* This is a very bare-bones implementation of very simple subtyping.  We only allow subtyping between constants with no parameters (such as ℤ ≤ ℚ ≤ ℝ).  And there is no user interface for creating subtyping relations, so we don't check that the subtyping is valid (e.g. shared constructors or destructors); we trust the programmer to know what they're doing.  We store the subtypes in a state effect. *)
